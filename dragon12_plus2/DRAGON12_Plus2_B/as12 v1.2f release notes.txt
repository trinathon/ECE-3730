I added a form-feed character to the beginning of the list file. This is used by legacy
programs to identify the file format.

No other changes this time!



Please send me bug reports, and suggested coding changes. I can't spend a
lot of time on this because my job keeps me extremely busy. But I would
like to at least keep track of bugs and "known issues", and I'll publish
an updated list occasionally.
